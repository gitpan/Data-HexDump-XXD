Data-HexDump-XXD version 0.0.1

This module provides some functions to have hex dumps equal to those generated
by the B<xxd> application (the one used by B<vim> for hex dumps). At the moment
only basic dump and re-packing are supported, so no funny option.

    perl Makefile.PL

Alternatively, to install with Module::Build, you can use the following commands:
